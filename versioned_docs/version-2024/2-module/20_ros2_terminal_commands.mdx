# ROS2 Terminal Commands

## Creating ROS2 workspaces

Workspaces in ROS2 are locations where user-written code is stored and compiled. Workspaces can be located at any path; however, it is recommended to create them in the home directory. The below command navigates to home, creates a directory called `auvc_ws/`, navigates to `auvc_ws/src/`, then initializes the workspace using `colcon build`.

```zsh
cd && mkdir auvc_ws && cd auvc_ws && mkdir src && colcon build
```

## Creating ROS2 packages

To create a new ROS2 package, you must have a ROS2 workspace. Packages MUST be located within the workspace's `src` directory; e.g., `~/auvc_ws/src/my_package`.

```zsh
cd ~/auvc_ws/src && ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake my_package_name
```

## Compiling ROS2 packages

ROS2 utilizes a compiling tool called `colcon build`. When you use this tool, you MUST be in the workspace directory; e.g., `auvc_ws`. Check your current using `pwd` (print working directory).

```zsh
pwd
```

If your path does not look like `/home/YOUR_USERNAME/auvc_ws, DO NOT use `colcon build`. Instead, navigate to the workspace AND THEN run `colcon build`.

```zsh
cd ~/auvc_ws && colcon build
```

### Additional colcon build arguments

You can specify additional arguments while using `colcon build` to increase compiling speed. 

Adding `--packages-select MY_PACKAGE` allows you to recompile one specific package. 

```zsh
cd ~/auvc_ws && colcon build --packages-select YOUR_PACKAGE
```

Adding `--symlink-install` creates a symbolic link between currently existing files in `~/auvc_ws/src/YOUR_PACKAGE` and `~/auvc_ws/install`. If you use this argument, currently existing files AND ONLY those files will not need to be recompiled. If you do add or remove files, recompile.

```zsh
cd ~/auvc_ws && colcon build --symlink-install --packages-select YOUR_PACKAGE
```

### Sourcing the workspace

After you compile a package, if you added new executables, you must re-source the workspace.

```zsh
source ~/auvc_ws/install/setup.zsh
```

## Node Commands

### List all active nodes

```zsh
ros2 node list
```

## Topic Commands

### List all named topics

```zsh
ros2 topic list
```

### Check the message type of a topic

```zsh
ros2 topic type /your/topic
```

### View message data in the terminal

```zsh
ros2 topic echo /your/topic
```

### Manually publish data to a topic

```zsh
ros2 topic echo -1 /your/topic std_msgs/String '{data: "hello world"}'
```

## Package Commands

### Check what executables are in a node

```zsh
ros2 pkg interface show /your_package
```
