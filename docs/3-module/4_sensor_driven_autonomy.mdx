# 3.3 Sensor-Driven Autonomy

## Gazebo

[Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/) is a set of open source tools for simulating robots in an environment.
It is commonly used in robotics research and education.

We will be using Gazebo to simulate the BlueROV2 robot in a virtual pool environment.

:::note

We will be using `Gazebo Harmonic`, the latest LTS version of Gazebo.

:::

### Installation

The documentation for installing Gazebo can be found [here](https://gazebosim.org/docs/garden/install).
See "**Binary Installation**" for instructions on installing Gazebo on your operating system.
Below is a summary of the steps.

:::note

Only Ubuntu is fully supported by Gazebo, and macOS is partially supported.
On Windows the simulation will run in the WSL environment.

:::

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

First we need to install ruby from Homebrew:

```bash
brew install ruby
```

Then we have to add the Homebrew Ruby to our path:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$(brew --prefix)/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Now, we add the `osrf/simulation` tap:

```bash
brew tap osrf/simulation
```

:::tip Apple Silicon-based Macs

For Apple Silicon-based Macs, we need to modify the Formulae before installing Gazebo.

```bash
cd /opt/homebrew/Library/Taps/osrf/homebrew-simulation/Formula
sed -i '' 's|cmake_args << "-DCMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH=#{rpath}"|cmake_args << "-DCMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH=#{rpath};/opt/homebrew/lib"|' *.rb
```

:::

Next we install Gazebo:

```bash
brew install gz-harmonic
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu">

First, **in a WSL terminal**, update and install dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install lsb-release wget gnupg
```

Next, install the Gazebo package repository:

```bash
sudo wget https://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.gpg -O /usr/share/keyrings/pkgs-osrf-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/pkgs-osrf-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list > /dev/null
```

Finally, install `Gazebo Harmonic`:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gz-harmonic
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Testing

To test your installation, run the following command:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

In one terminal, run:

```bash
gz sim -v4 -s shapes.sdf
```

In another terminal, run:

```bash
gz sim -v4 -g
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu">

In one terminal, run:

```bash
gz sim -v4 shapes.sdf
```

You should see a window pop up with some 3D objects in it.

:::info

For **`WSL`** users, hardware acceleration (GPU) may not work properly inside of the virtual environment. If your simulation seems laggy, you can try switching to software acceleration (CPU).

To do so, add the following line to your `WSL`'s `.zshrc` file:

```zsh
export LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1
```

Then, source `.zshrc` in your `WSL` terminal and restart the simulation.

```zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```

## BlueROV2 Simulation

### Installation

In this course, you will use a custom simulation for the BlueROV2. To install the simulation, **clone the repository onto your macOs, Windows WSL, or Ubuntu machine**:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/blksail-edu/gazebo_bluerov2
```

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

Dr. Saad it is your time to shine !

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu">

Install the following dependencies:

```zsh
sudo apt install libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev rapidjson-dev libopencv-dev
```

Navigate to the `gazebo_bluerov2` repository, and then run the build command:

```zsh
./build.sh
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Testing

After the build is complete, you can start the simulation with:

```zsh
./launch_1x_bluerov2.sh
```

:::info

The `./` in the command is the relative path to the `build.sh` and `launch.sh` files. As is, the above commands only run if your working directory is the `gaebo_bluerov2` directory.

This command **MUST** be run from inside the `/gazebo_bluerov2` directory.
:::

### Environment Setup

Now that you can run the BlueROV2 Gazebo simulation, the Gazebo simulation must be bridged with ROS 2.

#### Raspberry Pi Configuration

In a terminal on the `backseat`, install the `ros_gz_bridge` package:

```zsh
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-ros-gz-bridge
```

Then, with your favorite text editor, open the `.zshrc` file and add the following lines:

```zsh
# Gazebo
export GZ_PARTITION=my_sim
export GZ_TRANSPORT_IP=192.168.3.2
export GZ_TRANSPORT_PUB_PORT=11345
export GZ_TRANSPORT_SUB_PORT=11346
export GZ_DISCOVERY_SERVER=192.168.3.1\:11345
```

These environment variables will help point the Raspberry Pi to the Gazebo simulation.

#### Laptop Configuration

:::warning

If you are using **Windows and WSL**, then for this section only, follow the Windows tab rather than the Ubuntu tab.

:::

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

:::danger

Dr. Saad part two, electric boogaloo !

:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

You must add similar environment variables to your `WSL`'s `.zshrc` file so that Raspberry Pi and Gazebo simulation can communicate. With your favorite text editor, open the `.zshrc` file in `WSL` and add the following lines:

```zsh
# Gazebo
export GZ_PARTITION=my_sim
export GZ_TRANSPORT_ID=192.168.3.1
export GZ_TRANSPORT_PUB_PORT=11345
export GZ_TRANSPORT_SUB_PORT=11346
```

After, source the `.zshrc` file:

```zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```

This alone is not enough to enable Gazebo communication between your Raspberry Pi and WSL.

##### WSL Network Mode

Since WSL is a virtual machine, it is by default an internal network interface, meaning that the WSL interface is only visible to Windows. To fix this, you can change WSL's network mode to mirrored.

In a `Windows PowerShell` terminal, open the `.wslconfig file`:

```zsh
cd
notpad .wslconfig
```

Insert the following lines to change WSL to have a `mirror` network mode, then save and close the file.

```zsh
[wsl2]
networkingMode=mirrored
```

To apply the changes, shutdown `WSL` from a `Windows PowerShell` terminal:

:::warning

This will close all running `WSL` terminals in your system.

:::

```zsh
wsl --shutdown
```

After the shutdown, you can open `WSL` again as normal and the changes will be applied. However, you are still not done.

##### WSL Firewall Access

Create a new Windows Firewall protocol to enable IPv4 communication between WSL and your Raspberry Pi. In a `Windows PowerShell` terminal, run:

```zsh
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "AUVC Allow ICMPv4 Inbound for WSL2" -Direction Inbound -Protocol ICMPv4 -Action Allow
```

You can test that this works by pinging your Raspberry Pi. In a `WSL` terminal, run:

```zsh
ping 192.168.2.2
```

Then, create two additional Windows Firewall protocols to allow access to the Gazebo ports:

```zsh
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "AUVC Allow Gazebo Ports 11345-11346 Inbound for WSL2" -Direction Inbound -Protocol UDP -LocalPort 11345-11346 -Action Allow
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "AUVC Allow Gazebo Ports 11345-11346 Outbound for WSL2" -Direction Outbound -Protocol UDP -RemotePort 11345-11346 -Action Allow
```

You can test that this is working by running the Gazebo simulation in a `WSL` terminal, and running the following command from your Raspberry Pi:

```zsh
gz topic -l
```

You should see a list of Gazebo topics from the Gazebo simulation running in `WSL`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu">

You must add similar environment variables to your `WSL`'s `.zshrc` file so that Raspberry Pi and Gazebo simulation can communicate. With your favorite text editor, open the `.zshrc` file in `WSL` and add the following lines:

```zsh
# Gazebo
export GZ_PARTITION=my_sim
export GZ_TRANSPORT_ID=192.168.3.1
export GZ_TRANSPORT_PUB_PORT=11345
export GZ_TRANSPORT_SUB_PORT=11346
```

After, source the `.zshrc` file:

```zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```

You can test that this is working by running the Gazebo simulation in a terminal on your Ubuntu local machine, and running the following command on the `backseat`:

```zsh
gz topic -l
```

You should see a list of Gazebo topics from the Gazebo simulation.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

##

## ROS 2 Gazebo Bridge

To communicate with the BlueROV2 simulation, you will use the `ros_gz_bridge` package. The `rosmav` package contains a launch file that is already configured for both our single-rov and double-rov simulations.

:::warning

The bidge node should be started after the Gazebo simulations to ensure it functions properly.

:::

To start the bridge, run the following command in a terminal on the `backseat`:

```zsh
ros2 launch rosmav bridge.launch.py
```

This node will convert Gazebo messages to ROS 2 messages for crucial onboard components like the camera, IMU, magnetometer/compass. It is also configured for thruster manual inputs; however, we **WILL NOT** be using these to control the ROV(s).

## ArduSub with Gazebo

To control the BlueROV2 in the Gazebo simulation, you will use the `rosmav` package to establish a `MAVLINK` connection instances of the `SITL`. The `SITL` will then control the BlueROV2 inside of the Gazebo world. Each simulated vehicle in the Gazebo world must use a different port for the `SITL`.

:::info

When we used the `SITL` with `QGroundControl`, we used port `14550`. This port is specific to `QGroundControl` and will not be used while running Gazebo simulation.

:::

### Simulating 1x ROV

In the **`launch_1z_bluerov2.sh`** file, a Gazebo sim is started containing a single BlueROV2 that uses **port** **9002** for `MAVLINK`. To connect to this vehicle with the `SITL`, the port must be changed to `9002`. The command below also adds the argument `-I 0`, indicating that this `SITL` is instance 0.

```zsh
~/ardupilot/Tools/autotest/sim_vehicle.py --vehicle=ArduSub --aircraft="bwsibot" -L RATBeach --out=udp:192.168.3.1:9002 -I 0
```

### Simulating 2x ROV

In the **`launch_2x_bluerov2.sh`** file, a Gazebo sim is started containing two BlueROV2s that use **ports** **9002** and **9012**, respectively. To connect to these vehicles with the `SITL`, two instances must be started in separate terminals.

In the first terminal, you can run:

```zsh
~/ardupilot/Tools/autotest/sim_vehicle.py --vehicle=ArduSub --aircraft="bwsibot" -L RATBeach --out=udp:192.168.3.1:9002 -I 0
```

In the second terminal, you will run:

```zsh
~/ardupilot/Tools/autotest/sim_vehicle.py --vehicle=ArduSub --aircraft="bwsibot" -L RATBeach --out=udp:192.168.3.1:9012 -I 1
```

:::info

Notice how the port and instance indices change between each command. These link each `SITL` instance to the corresponding BlueROV2 model in the Gazebo world.
