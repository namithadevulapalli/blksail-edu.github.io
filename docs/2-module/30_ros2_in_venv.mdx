# 2.3 Virtual Environments

## Virtual Environment Setup

ROS 2 executables can be compiled to run inside of virtual environments if additional changes are made to the package.

1. Create a new virtual environment called `tutorials`. When you create virtual environments for use with ROS 2, you must include the `--system-site-packages` argument.

```zsh
mkvirtualenv tutorials --system-site-packages
workon tutorials
```

:::info

The `--system-site-packages` argument gives the virtual environment access to the system site-packages directory, which is essential for accessing system packages.

:::

2. Install `numpy` in the virtual environment.

```zsh
pip install numpy
```

### Package & Node Setup

3. Create a new package in your `auvc_ws` workspace called `tutorial_virtualenvs`.


```zsh
cd ~/auvc_ws/src && ros2 pkg create tutorial_virtualenvs --build-type ament_python
```

:::info

Compiling ROS 2 executables for virtual environments requires that all nodes in the package use the same virtual environment.

:::

4. Within your package, create a new python file called `virtualenvs.py`.

This file will contain a node that imports numpy from the virtual environment. The node will utilize numpy to perform a quick calculation that is logged to the terminal, and then the node will shutdown.

```py

import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node

import numpy as np
import sys


class VirtualEnvironmentsTutorial(Node):
    """
    This node demonstrates how ROS 2 packages can be compiled to run executables in a virtual environment.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("tutorial_virtualenvs")

        self.declare_parameter("theta", 3.14159)    # parameter name and default value in radians

        self.theta = self.get_parameter("theta").value
        self.get_logger().info(sys.executable)


    def run(self):
        """
        This method logs the sin of the theta parameter using the numpy library to the terminal.
        """
        solution = np.sin(self.theta)
        self.get_logger().info(f"sin({self.theta}) = {solution}")


def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    node = VirtualEnvironmentsTutorial()

    try:
        node.run()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\nKeyboardInterrupt received, shutting down...")
    finally:
        node.destroy_node()
        if rclpy.ok():
            rclpy.shutdown()
```

5. Update `package.xml` and `setup.py`.

In `package.xml`, add the `rclpy` dependency below the license tag.

```xml
<depend>rclpy</depend>
```

In `setup.py`, add the executable to console_scripts.

```py
entry_points={
    'console_scripts': [
        'virtualenvs = tutorial_virtualenvs.virtualenvs:main',
    ],
},
```
{/*
### Update setup.cfg

6. Ensure the new virtual environment is activated and find the its path with `which python`. The name of the virtual environment will be on the left of the terminal line if it is activated. If it is not activated, first run `workon tutorials`.

7. Modify `setup.cfg` \(setuptools config file\) and add the following lines at the top of the document. **Replace the placeholder path with the path to YOUR virtual environment from the previous step.**

```cfg
[build_scripts]
executable=<YOUR_PATH>
``` */}

6. In `setup.py`, add the following import and lines at the top of the file.

```py
import os

home_path = os.path.expanduser("~")
executable_path = os.path.join(home_path, '.virtualenvs', 'tutorials', 'bin', 'python')
```

The `executable_path` variable in this python code represents your system's path to the the virtual environment called `tutorials`.

:::info

In the future, when you create a new virtual environment for a ROS 2 package, you should follow this same procedure and replace `tutorials` with the name of your virtual environment.

:::

7. In `setup.py`, below the `entry_points` argument, add a new argument called options:

```py
options={
    'build_scripts': {
        'executable': executable_path,
    }
},
```

This option specifies that the package should build the executables to run in the python located at the executable path; i.e., inside your virtual environment.

8. Compile your new package, source the workspace, and then test the node.

To compile the new package, navigate to the workspace directory and run the colcon build command.

```zsh
cd ~/auvc_ws && colcon build --packages-select tutorial_virtualenvs
```

Then source the setup.zsh file inside the workspace. *Alternatively, you may source the `.zshrc` file since it will source the workspace.*

```zsh
source ~/auvc_ws/install/setup.zsh
```

Lastly, test your node. Try changing the parameter to different values to see if the node behaves as expected.

```zsh
ros2 run tutorial_virtualenvs virtualenvs --ros-args -p theta:=0.00
```

## Problem Set

In this problem set, you will use a custom service type provided to you.

Clone the package containing the custom service type into your workspace's `src` directory, then compile the package and source the workspace.

```zsh
cd ~/auvc_ws/src && git clone https://github.com/blksail-edu/example_custom_srv
cd ../ && colcon build --packages-select example_custom_srv
source install/setup.zsh
```

### Problem One

In your `tutorial_virtualenvs` package, create a new node called `physics_sim.py`. This node will simulate the motion of the BlueROV2 in the 2D plane using code from **Underwater Physics Problem Ten**. This node should meet the following requirements:

1. Create a service using the `SimulateAUV2Motion` service type.
2. Create a callback function for the service named `run_simulation`.
3. Run your `simulate_auv2_motion` function in the service's callback function.
4. Plot the simulated motion and save the plot on the `backseat`.

:::info

In your imports, add the following line:

```py
from example_custom_srv.srv import SimulateAUV2Motion
```

Then, in your initializer, create the service using:

```py
self.srv = self.create_service(
    SimulateAUV2Motion,    # service type
    'run_auv2_motion_simulation',    # service name
    self.run_simulation    # callback method for service
)

```

Your callback function for a service takes two inputs, a request and a response:

```py
def run_simulation(self, request, response):
    try:
        # REPLACE WITH YOUR CODE
        #
        #

        response.success = True
    except:
        response.success = False

    return response
```

Inside the callback funtion, use the request to obtain the inputs for your `simulate_auv2_motion` function \(similarly to how you obtain data from a ROS 2 msg\).

:::

Test your node with the following command:

```zsh
ros2 service call 'run_auv2_motion_simulation' example_custom_srv/srv/SimulateAUV2Motion "{}"
```
