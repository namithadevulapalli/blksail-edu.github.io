# 1.6 Underwater Physics

## Buoyancy

Archimedes' principle states that the upward buoyant force that is exerted on a body immersed in a fluid, whether fully or partially submerged, is equal to the weight of the fluid that the body displaces.
This principle is essential for understanding the physics of underwater vehicles.

The buoyancy force is given by the following equation:

$$
F_b = \rho \cdot V \cdot g
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid,
$V$ is the volume of the fluid displaced by the body,
and $g$ is the gravitational acceleration.

## Pressure

The pressure at a given depth $h$ is given by the following equation:

$$
p = \rho \cdot g \cdot h
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid,
$g$ is the gravitational acceleration,
and $h$ is the depth.

## Equations of Motions (Newton's 2nd Law)

#### Translational Motion

Let's look at Newton's 2nd law of motion:

$$
F = m \cdot a
$$

where $F$ is the force applied to an object,
$m$ is the mass of the object,
and $a$ is the acceleration of the object.

#### Rotational Motion

Newton's 2nd law of motion can also be applied to rotational motion:

$$
\tau = I \times \alpha
$$

where $\tau$ is the torque applied to an object,
$I$ is the moment of inertia of the object,
and $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration of the object.

The torque $\tau$ is given by the following equation:

$$
\tau = r \times F
$$

where $r$ is the distance from the axis of rotation to the point where the force is applied,
and $F$ is the force applied to the object.

The moment of inertia $I$ is given by the following equation:

$$
I = \sum_i m_i \cdot r_i^2
$$

where $m_i$ is the mass of the $i$th particle,
and $r_i$ is the distance from the axis of rotation to the $i$th particle.

:::info
In our case, we will be dealing with a rigid body.
Therefore, we can use the following equation to calculate the moment of inertia:

$$
I = m \cdot r^2
$$

where $m$ is the mass of the object,
and $r$ is the distance from the axis of rotation to the center of mass of the object.
