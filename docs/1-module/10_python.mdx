# 1.1 Python

Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language.
It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming.
Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

Throughout the course, we will use Python to implement the algorithms we learn.
It is very useful to have a basic understanding of Python before starting the course.

## Virtual Environments

To avoid conflicts between different Python projects, it is a good idea to use
virtual environments. A virtual environment is a directory tree which contains
Python executable files and other files which indicate that it is a virtual
environment.

### Install

Let's install the `virtualenv` package and `virtualenvwrapper` extension for
Python.

```bash
pip3 install --user virtualenv virtualenvwrapper
```

### Augmenting our `.zshrc` with `virtualenvwrapper`

We will be adding some configuration to the `.zshrc` file.

Open the `.zshrc` file with your favorite text editor and add the following
lines:

```bash
# Python
export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin
source virtualenvwrapper.sh
```

## Jupyter

[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is an open-source web application that
allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations,
visualizations and narrative text.

We will be using Jupyter Notebook to write some assignments.

### Install

```bash
pip3 install jupyter
```

## Let's get started

A starter repository is available at [blksail-edu/python-refresher](https://github.com/blksail-edu/python-refresher).

Let's make a fork and start working on the exercises.

To fork the repository, click on the fork button on the top right corner of the repository page.
This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

Once the repository is forked, you can clone it to your local machine.
Get the URL of the repository from the address bar of your browser and run the following command:

```bash
git clone <url>
```

Now you can start working on the exercises.

### The starter repository

The starter repository contains the following files:

```
├── hello.py          # The main Python file
├── requirements.txt  # The list of dependencies
└── test_hello.py     # The test file
```

The repository also contains some configuration files located in `.vscode`.
These files are used by Visual Studio Code to configure the development environment.

There are some extensions that are useful for Python development, they are listed in `.vscode/extensions.json`.
When you open the `Extensions` tab in Visual Studio Code, you will be prompted to install these extensions.

Let's first create a virtual environment for our project.
We will be using the `virtualenvwrapper` package to manage our virtual environments.

```bash
mkvirtualenv python-refresher
```

This will create a virtual environment named `python-refresher` and activate it.

:::tip
You can deactivate the virtual environment by running the `deactivate` command.

At any time you can activate the virtual environment by running the `workon python-refresher` command.
:::

#### `requirements.txt`

The `requirements.txt` file contains a list of dependencies.
These are the packages that are required to run the code in the repository.

The list is empty for now, but we will be adding some dependencies later.

To install the dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### `hello.py`

The `hello.py` file contains a simple Python program that prints `Hello, World!` to the console.
It also contains a set of functions that we will be implementing in the exercises.

#### `test_hello.py`

The `test_hello.py` file contains a set of tests for the functions in `hello.py`.
We will be using these tests to check if our implementations are correct.

### Running the tests

To run the tests, we will use the `Testing` tab in Visual Studio Code.
The first time you open the `Testing` tab, you will be prompted to select a test framework.
Select `unittest` and click on `OK`.

Now you can run the tests by clicking on the `Run All Tests` button.

As you can see, all the tests are failing.
Can you find out why?

:::warning Check-off
Review with a TA or instructor to check-off this section.
:::

### Implement the functions

Let's implement the functions in `hello.py` so that the tests pass.

First make sure you understand what the functions are supposed to do.
Next, implement the tests one by one.
Now, you can implement the functions so that the tests pass.

:::tip
Every time you make a change to the code, you need to run the tests again to make sure that you didn't break anything.
:::

:::tip
Always keep track of your changes by committing them to the repository.
:::

You can see that some functions need `numpy` to work.
Let's add `numpy` to the list of dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
Now you can install the new dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

:::warning Check-off
Review with a TA or instructor to check-off this section.

All functions should be implemented and all tests should pass.
Write at least 3 tests for each function.

Make sure that you have committed your changes to the repository.

## Python Basics

### Variables

Variables are used to store values.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

```python
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)
```

Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.

```python
x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)
```

### Data Types

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

- Text Type: `str`
- Numeric Types: `int`, `float`, `complex`
- Sequence Types: `list`, `tuple`, `range`
- Mapping Type: `dict`
- Set Types: `set`, `frozenset`
- Boolean Type: `bool`
- Binary Types: `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`

#### Getting the Data Type

You can get the data type of any object by using the `type()` function:

```python
x = 5
print(type(x))
```

#### Setting the Data Type

In Python, the data type is set when you assign a value to a variable:

```python
x = "Hello World" # str
x = 20            # int
x = 20.5          # float
x = 1j            # complex
x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] # list
x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry") # tuple
x = range(6)      # range
x = {"name" : "John", "age" : 36}  # dict
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}  # set
x = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"}) # frozenset
x = True          # bool
x = b"Hello"      # bytes
x = bytearray(5)  # bytearray
x = memoryview(bytes(5)) # memoryview
```

#### Setting the Specific Data Type

If you want to specify the data type, you can use the following constructor functions:

```python
x = str("Hello World") # str
x = int(20)            # int
x = float(20.5)        # float
x = complex(1j)        # complex
x = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # list
x = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # tuple
x = range(6)           # range
x = dict(name="John", age=36) # dict
x = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # set
x = frozenset(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # frozenset
x = bool(5)            # bool
x = bytes(5)           # bytes
x = bytearray(5)       # bytearray
x = memoryview(bytes(5)) # memoryview
```

### Functions

A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
A function can return data as a result.

#### Creating a Function

In Python a function is defined using the `def` keyword:

```python
def my_function():
  print("Hello from a function")
```

#### Calling a Function

To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis:

```python
def my_function():
  print("Hello from a function")

my_function()
```

#### Arguments

Information can be passed into functions as arguments.
Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses.

You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.

The following example has a function with one argument (`fname`).
When the function is called, we pass along a first name, which is used inside the function to print the full name:

```python
def my_function(fname):
  print(fname + " Refsnes")

my_function("Emil")
my_function("Tobias")
my_function("Linus")
```

#### Parameters or Arguments?

The terms "parameter" and "argument" can be used for the same thing: information that are passed into a function.

From a function's perspective:

- A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.
- An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called.

### Loops

Python has two primitive loop commands:

- `while` loops
- `for` loops

#### The `while` Loop

With the `while` loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

```python
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
```

#### The `for` Loop

A `for` loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
```

#### The `break` Statement

With the `break` statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:

```python
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  if i == 3:
    break
  i += 1
```

#### The `continue` Statement

With the `continue` statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:

```python
i = 0
while i < 6:
  i += 1
  if i == 3:
    continue
  print(i)
```

### Classes and Objects

Python is an object oriented programming language.

Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.

A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

#### Create a Class

To create a class, use the keyword `class`:

```python
class MyClass:
  x = 5
```

#### Create Object

Now we can use the class named `MyClass` to create objects:

```python
class MyClass:
  x = 5

p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)
```

#### The `__init__()` Function

The examples above are classes and objects in their simplest form, and are not really useful in real life applications.

To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in `__init__()` function.

All classes have a function called `__init__()`, which is always executed when the class is being initiated.

Use the `__init__()` function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:

```python
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("John", 36)

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)
```

#### Object Methods

Objects can also contain methods. Methods in objects are functions that belong to the object.

Let us create a method in the Person class:

```python
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def myfunc(self):
    print("Hello my name is " + self.name)

p1 = Person("John", 36)
p1.myfunc()
```

#### The `self` Parameter

The `self` parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the class.

It does not have to be named `self` , you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class:

```python
class Person:
  def __init__(mysillyobject, name, age):
    mysillyobject.name = name
    mysillyobject.age = age

  def myfunc(abc):
    print("Hello my name is " + abc.name)

p1 = Person("John", 36)
p1.myfunc()
```

#### Modify Object Properties

You can modify properties on objects like this:

```python
p1.age = 40
```

## Python Modules

A module is a file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.

For example, `numpy` is a module that we can use to work with arrays:

```python
import numpy

arr = numpy.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

print(arr)
print(type(arr))
```

## Problem Set

### Problem 1

Create a simulation of a bank account.

- The account should have a balance, a name and an account number.
- The account should have a method to withdraw money.
- The account should have a method to deposit money.
- The account should have a method to print the current balance.

You need to design the class and implement the methods.
Write tests for the methods for all possible scenarios.
